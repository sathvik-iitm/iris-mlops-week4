## 🔄 Git Workflow Demonstrated

1. **Initial Setup**
```
   git init → Created main branch
   git add . → Staged initial files
   git commit → First commit
   git push → Pushed to GitHub
```

2. **Branch Strategy**
```
   git checkout -b dev → Created dev branch
   git push origin dev → Pushed dev to remote
```

3. **Feature Development**
```
   [on dev] → Made changes
   git add . → Staged changes
   git commit -m "..." → Committed
   git push origin dev → Pushed to dev
```

4. **Pull Request Flow**
```
   GitHub UI → Created PR from dev to main
   CI runs → Automated tests
   All checks pass → Ready to merge
   Merge PR → Changes in main
```
