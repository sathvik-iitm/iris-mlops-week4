---

## 🐳 Docker Implementation

**Image**: iris-classifier:latest (808MB)  
**Base**: python:3.10-slim  
**Tested**: ✅ All endpoints working

**API Endpoints**:
- GET / - Health status
- GET /health - Detailed health
- POST /predict - Single prediction
- POST /predict/batch - Batch predictions
- GET /model/info - Model metadata

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

**GKE Cluster**:
- Name: iris-cluster
- Status: ✅ Running
- Mode: Standard
- Zone: us-east1-b
- Nodes: 1

**K8s Resources**:
- Deployment: 1 replica with auto-restart
- Service: LoadBalancer (external access)
- Health checks: Liveness + Readiness
- Resources: 128Mi RAM, 100m CPU

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

**GitHub Actions Workflow**:
- Triggers on: push to main (app.py, Dockerfile changes)
- Builds Docker image
- Tests image (health check)
- Ready for Artifact Registry push
- Ready for K8s deployment

---

## 📊 Docker vs Kubernetes

**Docker Container**: Packages the application  
**Kubernetes Pod**: Runs it reliably at scale

**Key Differences**:
| Feature | Docker | K8s Pod |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Orchestration | None | Full |
| Scaling | Manual | Auto |
| Self-Healing | No | Yes |
| Load Balance | External | Built-in |

**Why K8s?** Auto-scaling, self-healing, zero-downtime updates, production-ready
